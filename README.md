A simple card app using Flutter of a Formula 1 Driver: Fernando Alonso.
Fernando Alonso is a Formula 1 racer. Debuted in 2001,drove for various successful teams such as Renault,McLaren,Ferrari,Alpine having 2 World championships and
still racing in the sport for the aim of the third wdc. Fernando really is an inspiring guy whose had a big sheer of badluck and obstacles in his career but his
determination to still push forward is amazing and inspiring. That's why he is my top driver and I chose him for this small project.
